# [HABIT LOGGER](#habit-logger)
This is .NET 7 C# console application.

It logs the drinking habits of the user and performs CRUD applications against a sqlite database.


## [REQUIREMENTS](#requirements)
- Register one habit
- Track the habit by the **quantity** (eg. number of glasses of water a day)
- Store and retrieve data from a **sqlite database**
- Upon start, create a database ***if one isn't already present***
- Also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- Show a menu of options
- Users should be allowed to **insert, view, delete and update** their logged habits.
- Handle all possible ***user input errors*** to prevent the application from crashes.
- The application should only be terminated when the user input is 0.
- ***Do not use any ORM*** to interact with the database
